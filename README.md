# Welcome to my Project Portfolio for GR5074 Advanced Machine Learning

## Project 1: Predict country level happiness
Predict a country is happy or not (Very High = Top 20% and Very Low = Bottom 20%) based on infomation like GDP per capita, social support, life expectancy, freedom to make life choices, generosity, and perceptions of corruption. 
dataset: U.N. World Happiness Data (249 countries and regions)
model: neural network with Keras

## Project 2: Brain tumor prediction
Use brain MRI images to predict if a tumor is present. 
dataset: Brain MRI (253 images)
model: neural network with Keras

## Project 3: Predict news category
Predict the category of a given news article based on a short text (about 200 words) from that article. 
dataset: BBC News (2225 texts)
model: neural network (including LSTM) with Keras
